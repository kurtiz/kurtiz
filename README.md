# Hi, I'm Aaron! 👋🏾

**Full-Stack Engineer | Cyber Security Analyst & Pentester | Open Source Leader**

I bridge the gap between robust software engineering and proactive security. I build high-performance, secure-by-design applications and am passionate about fostering the next generation of technical talent in Africa.

### 🏗️ What I’m Working On

* **[bVault-js](https://github.com/kurtiz/bvault-js):** A lightweight, secure JavaScript utility for handling sensitive data storage and vaulting logic. Focused on privacy-first browser and node environments.
* **Vedtrace:** My flagship project. I am architecting a secure, end-to-end tracing and data integrity system designed for [insert high-level goal, e.g., supply chain transparency or secure asset tracking]. *(Currently in private development)*.
* **[OSSAfrica](https://github.com/OSSAfrica):** Co-Founder and SIG (Special Interest Group) Lead. We are a growing global community focused on Open Source and Security in Africa, driving collaborative innovation and security awareness across the continent.

### 💎 Core Strengths & Expertise

* **Cyber Security & Pentesting:** Experienced in vulnerability assessment and penetration testing (VAPT). I apply a "Red Team" mindset to everything I build to ensure production code is hardened against modern exploits.
* **Secure Full-Stack Architecture:** Expert in building scalable systems using the MERN/PERN stack, with a heavy emphasis on secure authentication and data encryption.
* **Open Source Leadership:** Proven ability to lead communities, manage SIGs, and coordinate large-scale collaborative projects.
