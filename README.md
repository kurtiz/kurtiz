## Hi!👋🏾 Thanks for stopping by 😊

I'm a full-stack developer with expertise in web and mobile development. I love building responsive and user-friendly web and mobile applications that solve real-world problems. 

As a developer, I am always looking for ways to improve my skills and contribute to the open source community. I love working on projects that challenge me to learn and grow as a developer. You can check out some of my work on my GitHub page, and feel free to get in touch with me. 

I'm passionate about using technology to make the world a better place, and I'm excited to see where my skills as a developer will take me.

You can visit my 🌐 [website](https://aaron.ourtechnologies.org) to know more about me.

<!-- - 🔭 I'm currently schooling but I'm working a new open source [project](https://github.com/Melanin-Framework/). I hope you like it. -->
